# blimps & glimpses

Unrelevant, small piece of code, mainly experiments. Use it if you want, and let me know if these blimps land anywhere else.

## What's in here?

* [`bubble-jauge`](https://adri326.github.io/blimps/bubble-jauge/index.html): a percentage indicator
* [`bubble-loading`](https://adri326.github.io/blimps/bubble-loading/index.html): a dummy loading bar
* [`recaman`](https://adri326.github.io/blimps/recaman/index.html): the mighty spirally representation of the mighty Rec√°man sequence (don't worry if you have no idea what it is)
